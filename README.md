# IDGT 2018 project course - SitzSimulator

> Unity project for the Introduction to Game Development Tools course at the University of Turku

## Development 

Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:niemisami/SitzSimulator.git`

Open the `SitzSimulator` folder on Unity

## Notes

If using Visual Studio Code as a main code editor note that some Unity generated files and folders are hidden on the editor e.g. `ProjectSettings`. These files are neither auto generated or managed by Unity therefore not neccessary to display on the editor. 

Many files are also ignored from version control due the same reason. See `.gitignore` file.
